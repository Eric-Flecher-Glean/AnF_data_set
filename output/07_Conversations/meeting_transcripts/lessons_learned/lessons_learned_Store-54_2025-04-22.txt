[00:00:00] Sarah Chen: Thanks everyone for joining. Let's review Store-54's performance. We completed this project 45 days ago, so the data is fresh.
[00:01:28] David Park: Good timing. What are the key variances we need to understand?
[00:04:00] Lisa Thompson: Looking at the financials, we came in $-3,000 under budget on electrical. We estimated $35,000 but actual was $32,000.
[00:04:31] Sarah Chen: What drove that variance?
[00:06:41] Tom Wilson: We used TempMaster instead of our usual contractor. They had 9% under pricing but quality was excellent.
[00:07:25] David Park: Is this a one-time variance or should we consider TempMaster for our primary vendor rotation?
[00:09:35] Sarah Chen: Based on this project, I'd recommend adding them to our preferred vendor list. The 9% cost savings could be significant across our portfolio.
[00:11:53] Lisa Thompson: From a budget perspective, this saved us $3,000 and shows backup vendors can offer better value.
[00:14:04] Tom Wilson: Operationally, we should always get quotes from at least two contractors.
[00:15:07] Sarah Chen: I'll make sure these learnings get added to our knowledge base and shared with the broader team.
[00:16:32] David Park: Excellent work team. Let's apply these insights to our upcoming projects in the Columbus and Cincinnati markets.
