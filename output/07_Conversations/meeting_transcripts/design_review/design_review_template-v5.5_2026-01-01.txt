[00:00:00] Carlos Martinez: Thanks everyone for joining today's design review. We're here to discuss template version v5.5 and the proposed updates.
[00:02:57] David Park: Good. What are the key changes in this version?
[00:05:56] Carlos Martinez: The main update is to the electrical panel specification. We're moving from 200A panels to 400A panels for all new builds.
[00:07:30] Angela Wu: This change is driven by increased HVAC and lighting load requirements. We've seen undersized panels causing issues in 3 stores over the past last quarter.
[00:08:24] David Park: What's the cost impact of this change?
[00:10:18] Carlos Martinez: We're looking at approximately $5,000 additional cost per store. That's about 15% increase on electrical work.
[00:11:17] David Park: That's significant across our portfolio. But if we're seeing failures with the current spec, it's better to spec it correctly upfront. What's the timeline for rolling this out?
[00:12:14] Carlos Martinez: We propose making this effective 2026-03-07. All projects that haven't started construction yet would use the new spec.
[00:13:24] Angela Wu: From a technical perspective, the 400A panels panel provides sufficient capacity for future electrical loads and equipment upgrades. It future-proofs our stores for any additional electrical loads.
[00:15:01] David Park: Makes sense. Have we validated this against building codes in all our markets?
[00:15:33] Angela Wu: Yes, the 400A panels meets or exceeds code requirements in all markets where we operate. Some jurisdictions are actually moving toward requiring this as minimum spec.
[00:18:07] Carlos Martinez: We also recommend updating the cost model templates to reflect this change. The 15% increase should be built into baseline estimates going forward.
[00:19:05] David Park: Agreed. Let's move forward with template version v5.5. Make sure the update gets communicated to all project teams and update our estimating tools. When can we expect the updated documentation?
[00:21:29] Carlos Martinez: We'll have the updated template and communication out by 2026-02-12. I'll also schedule training sessions for the project teams.
[00:24:19] David Park: Excellent. This is exactly the kind of proactive design improvement we need. Thanks team.
