[00:00:00] Sarah Chen: Good morning. Let's run through this week's project status. We have 12 active stores in development.
[00:01:40] Jennifer Liu: I'll start with procurement updates. We're seeing lead time increases from our primary HVAC vendor - up to 10 weeks now.
[00:02:33] Sarah Chen: That impacts 3 stores in our current pipeline. Do we have mitigation options?
[00:04:13] Jennifer Liu: We can use our backup vendor, but that comes with a 15% cost premium. For critical timeline projects, it might be worth it.
[00:06:39] Sarah Chen: Let's evaluate on a case-by-case basis. Store-217 is time-sensitive, so let's plan for the backup vendor there.
[00:07:49] Jennifer Liu: Noted. I'll reach out to them this week.
[00:09:36] Sarah Chen: On budget status, how are we tracking for the month?
[00:12:34] Jennifer Liu: We're running 3% under budget across active projects. Most of that is due to favorable vendor pricing on recent contracts.
[00:13:11] Sarah Chen: Understood. Let's make sure we're capturing those learnings for future estimates. Any blockers I should be aware of?
[00:15:57] Jennifer Liu: Waiting on permit approval for Store-215 - should be resolved by end of week
[00:17:55] Sarah Chen: I'll work on unblocking that. For next week's priorities, we need to finalize estimates for 4 new stores and complete site visits for 2 others.
[00:20:22] Jennifer Liu: I'll make sure we have vendor availability confirmed for those site visits.
[00:21:07] Sarah Chen: Perfect. Let's connect offline if any urgent issues come up. Thanks everyone.
