[00:00:00] Sarah Chen: Thanks for joining. Let's dive into yesterday's site visit findings for Store-341. Tom, what did you discover?
[00:02:53] Tom Wilson: The electrical panel is significantly undersized for the new HVAC and lighting requirements. We're looking at a full panel upgrade to 400A. Based on what we did at Store-329, I'm estimating around $35,000 for the electrical work.
[00:04:37] Mike Rodriguez: That's going to push us over our initial budget. Store-329 came in at $32,000 for similar work, right? Can we match that?
[00:05:29] Tom Wilson: Store-329 was in the Columbus market where labor rates are lower. We're in Cincinnati here, and we're seeing 8% higher labor costs this year due to union contracts.
[00:06:50] Sarah Chen: Let me verify that against our regional modifiers... Yes, I'm seeing Cincinnati at 1.08x for electrical work. Tom, does your $35,000 estimate include that adjustment?
[00:08:49] Tom Wilson: Correct, that's with the 1.08x modifier applied. Also, I should mention the landlord has a requirement that all electrical work must use vendors from their approved list. That limits our negotiation flexibility.
[00:10:06] Sarah Chen: That's a new constraint I wasn't aware of. I'll need to document this as a store-specific constraint.
[00:10:41] Tom Wilson: The good news is that our usual electrical subcontractor, PowerTech Solutions, is on their approved list. But we can't shop around for better pricing like we normally would.
[00:11:32] Sarah Chen: Understood. Can you provide a detailed breakdown of the $35,000 estimate?
[00:13:35] Tom Wilson: Sure. We're looking at $15,000 for labor at Cincinnati rates, $18,000 for the panel and materials, and $2,000 for permits and inspections.
[00:14:30] Sarah Chen: That breakdown helps. Given the constraint and the regional factors, I think $35,000 is reasonable. From an operational perspective, how disruptive will this work be?
[00:15:14] Mike Rodriguez: We'll need to close the store for at least two days for the panel swap. Can we schedule that during our lowest traffic period?
[00:17:24] Tom Wilson: Typically we'd do electrical work mid-week. I'd recommend Tuesday-Wednesday to minimize customer impact.
[00:19:20] Sarah Chen: I'll coordinate with scheduling. Let me capture the action items: I'll update the cost estimate to include the $35,000 electrical upgrade, add the landlord vendor constraint to our constraints database, and work with you on scheduling the downtime.
