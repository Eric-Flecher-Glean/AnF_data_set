dialogue_scenarios:
  - speaker_role: Design Lead
    text: "Thanks everyone for joining today's design review. We're here to discuss template version {template_version} and the proposed updates."

  - speaker_role: VP Store Development
    text: "Good. What are the key changes in this version?"

  - speaker_role: Design Lead
    text: "The main update is to the electrical panel specification. We're moving from {old_spec} to {new_spec} for all new builds."

  - speaker_role: Architect
    text: "This change is driven by increased HVAC and lighting load requirements. We've seen undersized panels causing issues in {problem_count} stores over the past {time_period}."

  - speaker_role: VP Store Development
    text: "What's the cost impact of this change?"

  - speaker_role: Design Lead
    text: "We're looking at approximately ${cost_increase:,} additional cost per store. That's about {cost_increase_pct}% increase on electrical work."

  - speaker_role: VP Store Development
    text: "That's significant across our portfolio. But if we're seeing failures with the current spec, it's better to spec it correctly upfront. What's the timeline for rolling this out?"

  - speaker_role: Design Lead
    text: "We propose making this effective {effective_date}. All projects that haven't started construction yet would use the new spec."

  - speaker_role: Architect
    text: "From a technical perspective, the {new_spec} panel provides {technical_benefit}. It future-proofs our stores for any additional electrical loads."

  - speaker_role: VP Store Development
    text: "Makes sense. Have we validated this against building codes in all our markets?"

  - speaker_role: Architect
    text: "Yes, the {new_spec} meets or exceeds code requirements in all markets where we operate. Some jurisdictions are actually moving toward requiring this as minimum spec."

  - speaker_role: Design Lead
    text: "We also recommend updating the cost model templates to reflect this change. The {cost_increase_pct}% increase should be built into baseline estimates going forward."

  - speaker_role: VP Store Development
    text: "Agreed. Let's move forward with template version {template_version}. Make sure the update gets communicated to all project teams and update our estimating tools. When can we expect the updated documentation?"

  - speaker_role: Design Lead
    text: "We'll have the updated template and communication out by {communication_date}. I'll also schedule training sessions for the project teams."

  - speaker_role: VP Store Development
    text: "Excellent. This is exactly the kind of proactive design improvement we need. Thanks team."
