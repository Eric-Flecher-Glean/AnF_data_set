    text: "Thanks everyone for joining. Let's review {store_id}'s performance. We completed this project {days_since_completion} days ago, so the data is fresh."

  - speaker_role: VP Store Development
    text: "Good timing. What are the key variances we need to understand?"

  - speaker_role: Finance Analyst
    text: "Looking at the financials, we came in ${variance:,} {direction} budget on electrical. We estimated ${electrical_estimated:,} but actual was ${electrical_actual:,}."

  - speaker_role: Project Manager
    text: "What drove that variance?"

  - speaker_role: General Contractor
    text: "We used {backup_vendor} instead of our usual contractor. They had {variance_pct:.0f}% {direction} pricing but quality was excellent."

  - speaker_role: VP Store Development
    text: "Is this a one-time variance or should we consider {backup_vendor} for our primary vendor rotation?"

  - speaker_role: Project Manager
