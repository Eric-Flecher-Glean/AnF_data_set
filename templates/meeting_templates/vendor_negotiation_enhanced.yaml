  - speaker_role: Procurement Manager
    text: "Thanks for meeting with us today. We wanted to discuss current HVAC pricing and lead times for our upcoming store builds."

  - speaker_role: General Contractor
    text: "Absolutely. What specific units are you looking at?"

  - speaker_role: Procurement Manager
    text: "We need commercial units for 5-7 stores over the next quarter. Current lead time is showing {current_lead_time} weeks. Can you confirm that's accurate?"

  - speaker_role: General Contractor
    text: "Yes, unfortunately we're seeing longer lead times due to supply chain constraints. It's gone from {old_lead_time} weeks to {current_lead_time} weeks across all our suppliers."

  - speaker_role: Procurement Manager
    text: "That's going to impact our project timelines. What's driving the increase?"

  - speaker_role: General Contractor
    text: "{supply_chain_reason}. We're working with suppliers to improve this, but realistically it'll be {current_lead_time} weeks for the next {duration}."

  - speaker_role: Procurement Manager
    text: "Let's talk pricing. What are we looking at per unit for the commercial HVAC systems?"

  - speaker_role: General Contractor
    text: "Current pricing is ${unit_cost:,} per unit. That's up from ${old_unit_cost:,} last quarter, about {price_increase_pct}% increase."

  - speaker_role: Procurement Manager
    text: "That's a significant jump. Any opportunity for volume discounting if we commit to multiple units?"

  - speaker_role: General Contractor
    text: "For 5 or more units, we can offer {discount_pct}% off, bringing it down to ${discounted_cost:,} per unit. If you commit to 10 units, we can go to {higher_discount_pct}%."

  - speaker_role: Procurement Manager
    text: "Let me run the numbers on a 10-unit commitment. What about payment terms?"

  - speaker_role: General Contractor
    text: "Standard terms are {payment_terms}. For volume commitments, we can be flexible on the deposit."

  - speaker_role: Procurement Manager
    text: "I think we can work with that. Let me discuss the volume commitment with our project team and get back to you by end of week. The ${discounted_cost:,} pricing with {payment_terms} terms works for us if we can lock it in."

  - speaker_role: General Contractor
    text: "Perfect. I'll prepare a formal quote based on our discussion today."
