dialogue_scenarios:
  - speaker_role: Project Manager
    text: "Good morning. Let's run through this week's project status. We have {active_project_count} active stores in development."

  - speaker_role: Procurement Manager
    text: "I'll start with procurement updates. We're seeing lead time increases from our primary HVAC vendor - up to {lead_time} weeks now."

  - speaker_role: Project Manager
    text: "That impacts {affected_store_count} stores in our current pipeline. Do we have mitigation options?"

  - speaker_role: Procurement Manager
    text: "We can use our backup vendor, but that comes with a {cost_premium_pct}% cost premium. For critical timeline projects, it might be worth it."

  - speaker_role: Project Manager
    text: "Let's evaluate on a case-by-case basis. {critical_store} is time-sensitive, so let's plan for the backup vendor there."

  - speaker_role: Procurement Manager
    text: "Noted. I'll reach out to them this week."

  - speaker_role: Project Manager
    text: "On budget status, how are we tracking for the month?"

  - speaker_role: Procurement Manager
    text: "We're running {budget_variance_pct}% {budget_direction} budget across active projects. Most of that is due to {variance_reason}."

  - speaker_role: Project Manager
    text: "Understood. Let's make sure we're capturing those learnings for future estimates. Any blockers I should be aware of?"

  - speaker_role: Procurement Manager
    text: "{blocker_description}"

  - speaker_role: Project Manager
    text: "I'll work on unblocking that. For next week's priorities, we need to finalize estimates for {upcoming_store_count} new stores and complete site visits for {site_visit_count} others."

  - speaker_role: Procurement Manager
    text: "I'll make sure we have vendor availability confirmed for those site visits."

  - speaker_role: Project Manager
    text: "Perfect. Let's connect offline if any urgent issues come up. Thanks everyone."
