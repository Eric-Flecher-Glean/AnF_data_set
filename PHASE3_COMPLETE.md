## Sample Quality - Design Review v2.0

**Date**: 2025-02-20
**Template**: v2.0
**Participants**: Carlos Martinez, Angela Wu, David Park

**Dialogue Excerpt**:
```
[00:04:22] Carlos Martinez: The main update is to the electrical panel
specification. We're moving from 200A panels to 400A panels for all new builds.

[00:05:08] Angela Wu: This change is driven by increased HVAC and lighting
load requirements. We've seen undersized panels causing issues in 3 stores
over the past last quarter.

[00:07:37] David Park: What's the cost impact of this change?

[00:09:08] Carlos Martinez: We're looking at approximately $5,000 additional
cost per store. That's about 15% increase on electrical work.
```

**Quality Indicators**:
- ✅ Specific technical details (200A → 400A)
- ✅ Quantified problem (3 stores with issues)
- ✅ Cost impact ($5,000, 15% increase)
- ✅ Business justification
- ✅ Action items with owners and dates
